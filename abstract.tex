This is my abstract. Note that I'm using line breaks without trailing white spaces in this .tex file to
make version control work better. The XXXX is an important problem for researchers and this writing
project was written to provide a solution to this important problem. It contains an exploration
of the history of the problem, motivating its importance, an exploration of an application to
illustrate its importance, development and/or discussion of statistical software to apply
the solutions to the problem, a simulation study to explore the performance of the methods,
and a conclusion. It also contains useful references and an appendix containing code used.
Or maybe it doesn't do all this - it depends on what you do for your project.
