Review of the literature. \citet{emalgorithm} was a seminal paper describing maximum likelihood
estimation for incomplete data. We wrote an R package and talk about it here \citep{TDARpackage}.
Often, we cite proceedings papers \citep{plh-survey}, and sometimes we want to cite
two papers at once \citep{chen2018statistical,wasserman2004}.
