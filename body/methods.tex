I am describing statistical methods used in this work. Often, it is nice to have
some figures throughout the document

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{figures/correlation}
\caption{My favorite statistical cartoon \citep{xkcd}.}
\label{cartoon}
\end{figure}

Then, later in the text, we may reference Figure \ref{cartoon}.
