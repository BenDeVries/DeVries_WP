# Introduction {#sec:intro}

This is my introduction, Section \ref{sec:intro}. This problem is important because... Here is the motivation for my study.

In \ref{sec:background}, I will review the literature on this topic. \ref{sec:methods} describes my methods. Finally, in \ref{sec:conclusion}, I will discuss the implications of this research and future work.

## Subsection

This is a subsection in my Introduction section.

# Literature Review {#sec:background}

Review of the literature. \citet{emalgorithm} was a seminal paper describing maximum likelihood estimation for incomplete data. We wrote an R package and talk about it here \citep{TDARpackage}. Often, we cite proceedings papers \citep{plh-survey}, and sometimes we want to cite two papers at once \citep{chen2018statistical,wasserman2004}.

# Methods {#sec:methods}

I am describing statistical methods used in this work. Often, it is nice to have some figures throughout the document

```{=tex}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{figures/correlation}
\caption{My favorite statistical cartoon \citep{xkcd}.}
\label{cartoon}
\end{figure}
```
Then, later in the text, we may reference Figure \ref{cartoon}.

# Conclusion {#sec:conclusion}

Amazing conclusions will be described in this section.
