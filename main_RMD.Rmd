# Introduction {#sec:intro}
This is my introduction, Section \ref{sec:intro}. This problem is important because... Here is the motivation for my study.

In \ref{sec:background}, I will review the literature on this topic. \ref{sec:methods} describes my methods.
Finally, in \ref{sec:conclusion}, I will discuss the implications of this research and future work.

## Subsection

This is a subsection in my Introduction section.

# Literature Review {#sec:background}
Review of the literature. \citet{emalgorithm} was a seminal paper describing maximum likelihood
estimation for incomplete data. We wrote an R package and talk about it here \citep{TDARpackage}.
Often, we cite proceedings papers \citep{plh-survey}, and sometimes we want to cite
two papers at once \citep{chen2018statistical,wasserman2004}.


# Methods {#sec:methods}

I am describing statistical methods used in this work. Often, it is nice to have
some figures throughout the document

\begin{figure}[h]

\label{cartoon}
\end{figure}

Then, later in the text, we may reference Figure \ref{cartoon}.

# Conclusion {#sec:conclusion}

Amazing conclusions will be described in this section.
